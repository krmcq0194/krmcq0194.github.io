    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
        <strong>Tally: Simple Debt Tracker</strong><br>
        Last Updated: January 2026
    </p>

    <p>
        Tally (“the App”) is designed with privacy as a core principle.
        This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Tally does not require you to create an account and does not collect personally identifiable
        information for the purpose of identifying you.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App may process the following information only as entered or provided by you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names, nicknames, or labels you assign to contacts</li>
        <li>Optional contact photos</li>
        <li>Notes, debt amounts, payment history, and interest details</li>
        <li>Locally stored app preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is used solely to provide the App’s core functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage &amp; iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored in one of the following ways, based on your preferences:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On-device only, or</li>
        <li>On-device and in your private iCloud account using Apple’s iCloud (CloudKit) services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All iCloud data is stored in your private iCloud container and is not accessible to the developer.
        Tally does not operate its own servers for user data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payments &amp; Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
        All purchases, subscriptions, and payments are processed exclusively through Apple’s
        In-App Purchase system.
    </p>
    <p>Tally does not collect, store, or process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment card details</li>
        <li>Billing information</li>
        <li>Transaction histories tied to your identity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Apple handles all payment data according to its own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Analytics, Tracking &amp; Advertising</h2>
    <p>Tally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not use third-party analytics tools</li>
        <li>Does not track users across apps or websites</li>
        <li>Does not use data for advertising</li>
        <li>Does not sell user data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Apple-provided crash reports and diagnostics may be used to improve app stability.
        These reports are handled by Apple and do not personally identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Communications &amp; Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        When you choose to send a reminder or summary via SMS, iMessage, or email:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Messages are generated locally on your device</li>
        <li>Messages are sent using Apple’s system share features</li>
        <li>No message content is transmitted or stored by the developer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Contacts Access</h2>
    <p>If you allow access to Contacts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contact information is used only to help you select or associate people within the App</li>
        <li>Contact data is not uploaded, shared, or stored outside your device or iCloud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may also manually enter contact information without granting Contacts access.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security &amp; Biometric Protection</h2>
    <p>
        Tally supports Face ID, Touch ID, or a device passcode to protect access to the App.
    </p>
    <p>Biometric information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is handled entirely by iOS</li>
        <li>Is never accessed, stored, or transmitted by Tally</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Deletion &amp; Portability</h2>
    <p>You are always in control of your data.</p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual entries or all app data at any time</li>
        <li>Permanently remove both local and iCloud-stored data</li>
        <li>Export your data in supported formats without contacting support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Tally is not directed toward children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect
        personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Future Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If Tally introduces new features that affect data usage (such as advertising or analytics),
        this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. You will always be able to review the latest
        version before changes take effect.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Because Tally does not collect or store user data on external servers, all data access,
        modification, and deletion is handled directly within the App.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
